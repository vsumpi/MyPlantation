# MyPlantation ðŸŒ±
I'm working on a python app that would help with my spring plantation project. :smile:
First time using SQLite for a DB and this is my second biggest project IRL.

I would plant around 20 different types of plants and a total of 500+ plants. I'll update this tread if any.

Solution for:
- tracking what and where is planted
- irrigation plan for all plants
- graph for growth and success rate
more addons later
